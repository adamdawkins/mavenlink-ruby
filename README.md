# Mavenlink Ruby API

A wrapper for the Mavenlink API in Ruby, heavily inspired by [stripe-ruby](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby)

# DO NOT USE
*This gem is a work in progress, and I am only developing the features that I need for a specific Mavenlink integration currently.*
That said, if you like this approach, and specifically prefer it to [mavenlink_gem](https://github.com/mavenlink/mavenlink_gem), then let me know, and maybe we could collaborate to take it further.
